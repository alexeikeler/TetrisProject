Time: ~ 20 hours

Most of the time was spent to figure out the behaviour of Tetromino (moving rotation, collision with walls).

Also I tried to separate code logically based on the behaviour of the functions (computation of the coordinates in one part, drawing in another),
but of course it's not 100% corrent and will be rewritten later.

Currently the TetrisGameMain is also not 100% corrent, and overall
the whole programm currently is just a test field for the behaviour of the TetrominoI.




Here is couple of things that I'm currently not sure about:

1. Despite we are writing different terminal managers in different files
I want to keep abstract class for Tetromino in one file and all classes (for different shapes)
in another file, because they are very similar to each other. So overall 3 files for the Tetromino figures:
    
    * AbstractTetromino.h
    * Tetromino.h
    * Tetromino.cpp

2. I'm not sure if I need to write tests for functions like TetrisGame.play() or TetrisGame.drawBorders(),
because they are trivial in a sence, that they are just drawing pixels. 
Probably I'll end up creating another mock class to test that (like with TerminalManager).
